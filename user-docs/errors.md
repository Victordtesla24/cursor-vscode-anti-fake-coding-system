POST-UNINSTALL RECOMMENDATIONS:
  - Restart your terminal for all changes to take effect.
  - If you had custom shell configurations for Cursor, you may want to remove them manually from your shell profile (e.g., ~/.zshrc, ~/.bash_profile).
  - A system restart is recommended to ensure all system-level caches are cleared.
