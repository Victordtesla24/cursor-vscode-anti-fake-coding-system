2.  **No Duplication:**
    *   **STRICTLY FORBIDDEN:** Creating new, unnecessary, or duplicate files, code blocks, or scripts.
    *   **MANDATORY:** Before creating anything new, you **MUST** thoroughly search the existing codebase for files or modules with similar functionality. Reuse and refactor existing assets whenever possible, following the `my-directory-management-protocols.mdc`.
